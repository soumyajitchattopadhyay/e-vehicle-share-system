# lb01-12-backend

As part of the 2024 Team Project, this assignment involved creating a fully functional prototype for an electric vehicle sharing platform. The platform, named "ElVe," was developed to enable seamless reservation, tracking, and management of electric scooters and bikes within urban environments, fulfilling the primary project objectives outlined by the university.

The project specifications required us to build a web application using Django for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend, ensuring an intuitive interface for diverse user roles. Specifically, the platform was designed to support three user roles: Customers, Operators, and Managers, each with tailored functionalities. Customers can reserve and return vehicles, pay bills, and report defects. Operators manage vehicle locations, monitor battery levels, and handle maintenance, while Managers can generate visualized usage reports to optimize fleet deployment.

To meet the project requirements, we implemented core features such as real-time vehicle tracking, automated billing based on vehicle type and rental duration, and data management using PostgreSQL. Additionally, we incorporated extra functionality beyond the specified requirements, including enhanced data visualization tools for Managers and a user-friendly reporting interface for Operators to log and track vehicle maintenance needs.

This report discusses how the project specifications were addressed in detail, our design decisions, and the collaborative tools used for team coordination. Furthermore, it explores potential areas for future enhancement, such as implementing advanced predictive algorithms to forecast vehicle demand and integrating multi-city functionality to expand the platform's scope. Through this project, our team gained practical experience in system design, real-time data handling, and collaborative development, laying a foundation for future projects in sustainable urban mobility solutions
